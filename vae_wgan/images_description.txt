NF_heatmap.eps

-heatmap of log probabilities by a trained NF on a target distribution
The target distribution is a multivariate gaussian centered at (5,5) with std 1


WGAN_heatmap_single_models.eps

-heatmap of 4 single models with extra training.  Each model is trained and extra trained on the target distribution, 
which is a multivariate gaussian centered at (5,5) with std 1

WGAN_heatmap_ensemble_mean.eps

-Taking ensemble mean of the probabilities of above 4 single models

WGAN_heatmap_ensemble_variance.eps

-Taking ensemble variance of the probabilities of above 4 single models



creditcard_single_elbo.eps

-ELBOs of single model trained on creditcard dataset

creditcard_ensemble_elbo_mean.eps

-ELBOs of ensemble of 5 models.


VAE_mnist_single_elbo.eps

-ELBOs of single model trained on MNIST

VAE_mnist_ensemble_elbo_mean.eps

-ensemble mean of elbos of 5 models.


WGAN_mnist_auroc.eps

-AUROC comparison between WGANs trained on MNIST with and without extra training.
There are three subplots because 
single logit/ ensemble mean of logits/ ensemble var of logits are the three threshold variables.

The order of datasets is

1.mnist nsd by normal
2.mnist nsd by uniform
3.mnist nsd by brighten
4.mnist nsd by hor_flip
5.mnist nsd by ver_flip
6.notMNIST
7.fashion_mnist
8.fashion_mnist nsd by normal
9.normal_noise
10.uniform_noise
11.adv_normal_noise
12.adv_uniform_noise

WGAN_mnist_auroc_version2.eps

-Same as WGAN_mnist_auroc.eps, 
but each subplot represents each dataset and is labeled with the name of the dataset. 
In each subplot, there are AUROC comparisons of with/without extra training using ensemble mean and ensemble variance.



WGAN_cifar10_auroc.eps

-AUROC comparison between WGANs trained on CIFAR10 with and without extra training.
There are three subplots because 
single logit/ ensemble mean of logits/ ensemble var of logits are the three threshold variables.


The order of datasets is

1.CIFAR10 nsd by normal
2.CIFAR100
3.SVHN
4.ImageNet
5.CelebA
6.normal_noise
7.uniform_noise
8.adv_normal
9.adv_uniform


WGAN_cifar10_auroc_version2.eps

-Same as WGAN_cifar10_auroc.eps, 
but each subplot represents each dataset and is labeled with the name of the dataset.  
In each subplot, there are AUROC comparisons of with/without extra training using ensemble mean and ensemble variance.
