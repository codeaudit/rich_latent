Inside 'plots_and_pickles/pickles'

There are 6 pickles in total

Each pkl is a list of dictionaries.

Each of the dictionaries is as follows:
  key                  value

'dataset' :          out of distribution dataset name 
'threshold_var' :    single_elbo(or logit)/ensemble mean/ensemble var that serves as a threshold variable
'values' :           array of the raw values of the above variable 
'AUROC':             AUROC score of this dataset against normal data
'AP' :               Average Precision score of this dataset against normal data
'FPR@95%TPR' :       false positive rate at 95 % true positive rate
